  # This will set ${MQTT_PASSWORD} to the 'password' key from the 'mqtt' secret

## If you'd like to provide your own Kubernetes Secret object instead of passing your values
## individually, pass in the name of a created + populated Secret.
## All secrets will be mounted as environment variables, with each key/value mapping to a
## corresponding environment variable.
